## Write a recursive function which returns a Boolean value

Return true if the string is a palindrome and false if not. The function should ignore whitespace and be insensitive to capitals.

If the solution to this kata is still fresh in your mind after working on recursion, go back to sumConsecutiveDuplicates and try to implement the Extra Credit solution, which uses recursion.

#### examples

```
palindrome('cat')
  => false
```

```
palindrome('Acrobats stab orca')
  => true
```

```
palindrome('Are we not drawn onward to new era')
  => true
```
